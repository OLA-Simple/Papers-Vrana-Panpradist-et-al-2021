**Background**: Usability is an overlooked aspect of implementing lab-based assays, particularly novel assays in low-resource-settings. Esoteric instructions can lead to irreproducible test results and patient harm. To address these issues, we developed a software application “Aquarium” that provides step-by-step digital interactive instructions, protocol management, and sample tracking. We adapted Aquarium to run on tablets and paired it with a low-cost, near point-of-care HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) test, “OLA-Simple” that detects HIV mutations associated with virologic failure. We hypothesized that Aquarium would successfully guide untrained users in a low-resource-setting through the multi-step laboratory protocol with little supervision.
 
**Methods**: A feasibility study was conducted in a laboratory at Coptic Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. To evaluate the training by Aquarium software, twelve volunteers who were unfamiliar with the kit performed the test on blinded samples (10 codons for each technician). Steps guided by Aquarium included: CD4+ T cell separation, PCR, ligation, detection, and interpretation of test results. Participants filled out a short survey regarding their demographics and usage of software and kit.
 
**Results**: 12/12 technicians had no prior experience performing CD4+ separation and 0/12 no experience performing laboratory-based molecular assays. 12/12 isolated CD4+ T cells from whole blood samples (yield: 1.7±0.6 x 105 cells/mL). OLA-Simple workflow was completed by all, with correct interpretation of 90% (108/120) of codons. In the surveys, participants favorably assessed use of software guidance.
 
**Conclusions**: Aquarium could increase the accessibility of clinical laboratory assays in low-resource-settings and could potentially standardize implementation of clinical laboratory tests.
